# PipScript
  This script is designed to allow python modules to be downloaded on computers where the command line is inaccessible or Python is not in the system path and nothing can be done to change that.
  Instructions: Open the python file, run it, and either go for the custom installation method where you can type pip commands as if they were being done on the command line or go for the guided installation where you simply answer questions about what module you wish to install and what modifications you would like.
  License: CC BY, essentially you can change it however you want and use it for whatever, just give me credit for the base version and share your changes with others, making your alteration CC BY as well and informing me. <3
